					Hi! I'm Carter, a soon-to-be graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science from
                    Tennessee Tech University. I love cybersecurity, particularly offsensive security and defensive tooling.
                    I also enjoy building infrastructure and scaling cloud environments.
                </p>
                <p className="about-paragraph">
					Some more information about me, I enjoy writing, going on walks, and web development in my free time.
                    I have three dogs, Cooper, Carley, and Charlie, who keep me pretty busy. Feel free to connect with me on
                    LinkedIn, I'd love to network!
